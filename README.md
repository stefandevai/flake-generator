- Generates [N-flake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-flake) fractals such as a Sierpinski triangle, a Vicsek fractal, a pentaflake, an hexaflake and others n-flakes;

# Instructions
- It only has **PyGame** module as a dependency
- Download the repo, install [Python 3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download), install [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Pygame%20Installation) and run `python n-flake-generator.py`

- **Linux** instructions if you already have git, python and pip installed:

`$ git clone https://github.com/stefandevai/n-flakes` <br>
`$ cd n-flakes` <br>
`$ pip install pygame` <br>
`$ python n-flake-generator`

- You will be asked if you want to run the **interactive mode** (option 1) or an **example demonstration** (option 2);
- For the interactive mode, you can choose the number of vertices, the number of iterations to build the flake, if you want it with a color scheme or outlined, like in the examples above;

- While running the **interactive version**, you can:
	- Increase/decrease the **number of interactions** with right/left arrow keys;
	- Increase/decrease the **number of vertices** with up/down arrow keys;
	- Toggle **colorful** mode with the C key;
	- Toggle **outline** mode with the O key.
